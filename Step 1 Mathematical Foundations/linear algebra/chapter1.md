## Chapter 1: Systems of Linear Equations: Algebra

> **Primary Goal:** Solve a system of linear equations algebraically in parametric form.

### 1.1 Systems of Linear Equations

> **Definition:** An equation in the unknowns x,y,z,... is called linear if both sides of equation are a sum of (constant) multiples of x,y,z,..., plus an optional constant.

For instance:
$$
3x + 4y = 2z \\
-x - z = 100
$$

We will usually move the unknowns to the left side of the equation, and move the constants to the right.
$$
3x + 4y - 2z = 0 \\
-x - z = 100
$$

**A system of linear equations** is a collection of serveral linear equations, like
$$
\begin{cases}
\begin{aligned}
x + 2y + 3z &= 6 \\
2x - 3y + 2z &= 14 \\
3x + y - z &= -2
\end{aligned}
\end{cases}
$$

> Definition (Solution sets):
- **A solution** of a system of equations is a list of numbers x,y,z,... that make all of equations true simultaneously.
- The **solution set** of a system of equations is the collection of all solutions.
- **Solving** the system means finding all solutions with formulas involving some number of parameters.

A system of linear equations need not have a solution. In this case:
$$
\begin{cases}
\begin{aligned}
x + 2y =3 \\
x + 2y = -3
\end{aligned}
\end{cases}
$$
It has its own name.

> Definition: A system of equations is called **inconsistent** if it has no solutions. It is called **consistent** otherwise.

R denote the set if all real numbers, i.e., the number line.

> Definition: Let n be a positive whole number. We define
$$
\mathbb
{R}^n = \text{all ordered } n\text{-tuples of real numbers } (x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n).
$$
An n-tuple of real numbers is called **a point of $\mathbb{R}^n$**.<p>

The number line: $\mathbb{R}$<p>
The Euclidean plane (xy-plane): $\mathbb{R}^2$<p>
3-Space: $\mathbb{R}^3$<p>
